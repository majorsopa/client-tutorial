# Downloading the stuff

## Things that need to be downloaded

* Java Runtime \(JRE\)
* Java Developer Kit \(JDK\)
* Integrated Development Environment \(IDE\)
* Gradle
* Git

## Installing JRE

The JRE downloads for JRE 8 can be found here: [https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jre8-downloads.html](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jre8-downloads.html)

Other versions can also be found on that website.  It may require an account.  Note that for Minecraft 1.17+ you need version 16+.  

## Installing JDK

The JRE downloads for JDK 8 can be found here: [https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase-jdk8-downloads.html](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase-jdk8-downloads.htmlee)

Other versions can also be found on that website.  It may require an account.  Note that for Minecraft 1.17+ you need version 16+.  

## Installing an IDE

There are two main Java IDEs: Intellij IDEA and Eclipse.  This tutorial will use Intellij but you can use Eclipse or even VSCode for it.  Just remember that there is a reason this tutorial is using Intellij.  

Intellij Community Edition \(free version\) can be found here: [https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows)

Eclipse can be found here: [https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)

## Installing Gradle

Gradle is a tool that is used to automatically get and build potentially thousands of java files automatically.  In modern day java, a dependency manager like gradle is a necessity.  Maven is also an option, but for Minecraft mod dev, gradle is used almost exclusively.  

Gradle download and installation instructions can be found here: [https://gradle.org/install/](https://gradle.org/install/)

## Installing Git

Git is an incredibly powerful version control system.  It is what is at work behind the scenes on GitHub, and even this tutorial.  Even though it might not be used too much directly in this tutorial, you certainly will end up using both Git and GitHub while developing.  

Git can be downloaded from here: [https://git-scm.com/downloads/](https://git-scm.com/downloads/)
