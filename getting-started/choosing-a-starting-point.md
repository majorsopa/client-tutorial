# Choosing a starting point

## What version is this client for?

This guide is going to be focused on 1.16+ for the time being, because that is what I am most experienced in.  However, some of these things will still apply even if you're not using one of these versions.  

If you intend on making a client for minigames servers, you are better off on 1.7-1.8 as most of the servers for them are on those versions.  

If you intend on making an anarchy client, there are still some options to choose from.  Most anarchy servers are on version 1.12.2, but some are on 1.16+.  

## What style of client is it going to be?

There are two to choose from, really.  Either a jar you put in your mods folder, or an injection client which injects into the Minecraft process and modifies it through that.  Injection clients are common for minigames, but almost unheard of for anarchy.  Near nothing in this guide applies to injection clients.  

## Which mod loader?

As this guide is for 1.16+, Fabric and Forge are the two best options.  Weighing the pros and cons, I have decided that Fabric is superior for 1.16+ mods.  Because of this, this guide will not be focusing on Forge.  A lot of the semantics of how things work will be different on Forge, but the basic idea remains the same.
