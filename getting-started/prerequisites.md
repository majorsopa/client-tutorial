# Prerequisites

## Basic Java knowledge

This tutorial will try to guide you, however it assumes you have some knowledge in the Java programming language.  

## Common sense

This tutorial is going to guide you, not pick you up and carry you through the entire thing.  You need to be able to use Google and be able to look up questions effectively.  

## Minecraft Java Edition

You need a legitimate Minecraft Java account for this.  No cracked accounts, no Bedrock accounts.  

## A willingness to learn

A Minecraft client is not a super easy project, especially if it is going to have some effort put into it and not be skidded \(stolen, copied code\).  Don't give up half-way and decide you can't do it- it is not going to be a cakewalk.
