# Learning Fabric

A beginning mod in fabric, not a cheat but just how to get things set up: [https://fabricmc.net/wiki/tutorial:setup](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/tutorial:setup)

The fabric wiki is also a great place to look things up if you're stuck.  The fabric discord server is as well, as long as you don't mention the fact it is for a cheat.  If it is something specific to cheats, you can also ask around for the Utility Mod Development discord server.
